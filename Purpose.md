## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to provide an easy to use (highly opinionated) way to setup a "hybrid-local" (self hosted, but using cloud resources) LLM setup.

## Goal
- Running setup out of the box with little to no input necessary from user
- self hosted llm, openwebUI, searxNG
- llm pre-seeded and "warmed up" so that user can immediately use it without wait time
- openwebUI configured agentic for websearch (native rather than websearchtool)
